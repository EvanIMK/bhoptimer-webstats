#TODO


TBD
* [ ] Fix remaining elseif SQL queries.
* [ ] Figure out how to show rank per map when displaying one player's times without clobbering the database (indexes?)
* [ ] Rework table drawing into a function rather than, well, this.
* [ ] Make the timer-red.css stylesheet respect the alterations I've made.

Done
* [x] Add option to search by SteamID/Steamcommunity URL.
* [x] Add Top 10/50/100 Players page as ranked by total points earned.

Ongoing

* [ ] Cleanup. Pull requests appreciated.
* [ ] Reread bhoptimer SQL source to see if I can glean any improvements.
